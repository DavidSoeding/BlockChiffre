# BlockChiffre
I made this simple Xor Block-Chiffre for IT-Class in Grade 12.

This Java File asks for an ASCII-128 input text, aswell as a 4 digit code in the console and converts both into binary. The binary text gets chopped into blocks and each block gets Xor'd with the binary code. Between each Xor the code gets shuffled around. After the encryption is complete, the encrypted bits get converted into duodecimal and printed as the result.

The decryption java file works the same way, just backwards. It is mostly a copy paste of the encryption with the order switched around. Because of this many variable names do not make sense.
